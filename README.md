# Movies-ETL
Using the ETL to form datasets 
# Overview
In this case study, I used the ETL process to extract raw movie data from sites such as Kaggle and Wikipedia, and was able to turn the raw data into easy to navigate tables on SQL for the end user to analyze. The process invovled, downloading raw data and then through Python code in Pandas, turn the raw data into legible columns, while deleting unnecessary information and corrupt data. Once the individual datasets were cleaned, I then merged the different datasets into one dataset with the movie ratings being the main analysis point. Once the data was transformed into the new dataset, I then loaded the completed work into SQL so the end user could visualize the data with SQL's tables.
